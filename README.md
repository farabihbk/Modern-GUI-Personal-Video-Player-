# Modern-GUI-Personal-Video-Player-
This is the Modern Personal Video Player by using Python and  PQTGUI Libraries 
In this tutorial, we will build a simple video player using PyQt6 and the python-vlc library, a wrapper for the libvlc library used to interface with the VLC media player
Why Use VLC with PyQt6?
VLC is well-known for its powerful multimedia capabilities. But doesnâ€™t PyQt6 already have a native widget for playing media? So why use VLC?

Here are some benefits of using VLC in your project as opposed to PyQt6.

Wide Format Support: VLC can play nearly any video or audio format.
Cross-Platform: VLC works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
Feature-Rich: Beyond just playing files, VLC supports streaming (RTSP and HLS), subtitles, buffering support, synching mechanisms, and many advanced playback options.
By combining VLC with PyQt6, we can quickly build a flexible and robust media player with a graphical user interface (GUI).
